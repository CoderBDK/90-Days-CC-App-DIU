/**
 * For decades, as developers we are confronted with a problem to solve - how to prevent
 * our applications from blocking. Whether we're developing desktop, mobile, or even
 * server-side applications, we want to avoid having the user wait or what's worse
 * cause bottlenecks that would prevent an application from scaling.
 *
 * There have been many approaches to solving this problem, including:
 * Threading
 * Callbacks
 * Futures, promises, and others
 * Reactive Extensions
 * Coroutines
